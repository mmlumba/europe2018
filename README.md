# europe2018
A repo showing all the UNESCO world heritage sites I visited using the [UNESCO api](https://whc.unesco.org/). API information was converted from the [XLS file](http://whc.unesco.org/en/syndication) to a json file (output.json) using xml-to-json package. Also includes pictures I took on the trip for each site.
